# Summary

### This is my Artificial Intelligence Blog. You may find information about me, the Blog and its content in the "About Me" section of the Blog.

### Below, there are the posts that have been uploaded thus far. It is expected that most of them will be Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) posts with slight interactivity.

### Remember that the Jupyter Notebook posts can be opened in GitHub as well as in Google Collab. I try to keep everything working as smoothly as possible, however not every cell will run in every system, especially not if there is a specified path or missing dependencies or files.

### Feel free to reach out for a comment or question; I am always looking for interesting people to engage in discourse with.
