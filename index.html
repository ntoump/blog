# Summary

#### This is my Artificial Intelligence Blog. You may find information about me, the Blog and its content in <a href="https://ntoump.github.io/blog/about/">About Me.</a>

#### Below, there are the posts that have been uploaded thus far. It is expected that most of them will be Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) posts with slight interactivity.

#### Remember that the Jupyter Notebook posts can be opened in GitHub as well as in Google Collab. I try to keep everything working as smoothly as possible, however not every cell will run in every system, especially not if there is a specified path or missing dependencies or files.

#### Feel free to reach out for a comment or question; I am always looking for interesting people to engage in discourse with.
