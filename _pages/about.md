### Nikolaos Toumpanakis
I am an undergraduate student with a wide area of interests, especially in technology, philosophy/mathematics, international relations, and economics and finance.

#### Blog Focus
This Blog will mostly focus on the following vast fields: Artificial Intelligence, Machine/Deep Learning, and Data Science.

#### Goal
I created this blog (using <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a>) to share my technological findings and interests with the world.

#### My plans
I plan on delving deeply into AI and Deep Learning in the next few months, as I am fascinated by its seemingly infinite possible applications, as well as its future prospects.

#### Blog Content
Expect to read about my experiments, my ideas, and my projects, as I progress through the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fastai course</a>. 

#### Subscription
You can subscribe to receive an email notification every time a post is made <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a284bea6addb/subscribe">here.</a>

#### About me
As I am still but an ambitious student, you will encounter mistakes and potentially failures, both in my sometimes unorthodox methodologies, and even in my code. Slight inefficiencies will be ubiquitous, especially for the first few months. My personal aspiration, though, is that through thorough study and by maintaining a relentless and tenacious attitude, I will be able to improve myself and my capabilities beyond what I now consider possible.
